## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v16.4.2 or higher
npm@7.18.1 or higher
git@2.30.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ‚òùÔ∏è

```
yarn@v1.22.10 or higher
```

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cobiwave/simplefolio

# Move into the repository
$ cd simplefolio

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# 2022 Update - Fix Dependencies
$ npm audit fix
$ npm i @parcel/transformer-sass

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the development server
$ npm start
```

Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file before executing the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the development server
$ yarn start
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this below command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:1234/` to see the portfolio locally. It should look like the below screenshot.

### Step 2 - STYLES

Change the color theme of the website - (choose 2 colors to create a gradient)

Go to `/src/sass/abstracts/_variables.scss` and only change the values for this variables `$main-color` and `$secondary-color` with your prefered HEX color.
If you want to get some gradients inspiration I highly recommend you to check this website [UI Gradient](https://uigradients.com/#BrightVault)

```scss
// Default values
$main-color: #02aab0;
$secondary-color: #00cdac;
```

## Deployment üì¶

Once you finish your setup. You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) because it is super easy.
